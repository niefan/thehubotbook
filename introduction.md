# Introduction

The Hubot Book is a book I decided to write because I wanted to experience
writing a book, but also I wanted to write about a subject I passionate about. I
became a maintain of GitHub's Hubot because I felt it was a project that I felt
the majority of people would misjudge. I mean it's just a chat bot right? Wrong!

The goal of this book is to help new and existing users of Hubot to get the most
out of using Hubot, whether its for personal or use within a company. You'll
learn how to install and deploy your own Hubot, how to write fun and useful
scripts to make your Hubot do your bidding. Also I hope to explain a lot of the
internals that make Hubot work so you too can hopefully contribute to Hubot as
well as open sourcing your own Hubot scripts.

This book makes the assumption that you are comfortable working in a UNIX
environment and tools like Git. The later chapters will require you to have a
good understanding of Node and CofeeScript.
