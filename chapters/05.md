# Internal HTTP Server

Hubot has an internal HTTP server built in using Express. This allows scripts to
specify "routes" in Hubot that can be handled by Express internally.

## Getting Started

By default the internal HTTP server is enabled. There is also a default script
that exposes some routes that you can check out.

  * `GET /hubot/version` - will return the version as the response body
  * `POST /hubot/ping` - will return "PONG" as the response body
  * `GET /hubot/time` - will return the current server time as the response body
  * `GET /hubot/info` - will return some info around the hubot process as the
    response body
  * `GET /hubot/ip` - will return the external IP of the hubot as the response
    body.

The basics of a HTTP handler in Hubot is a route and a callback to call when
there is a request made to that route using the specified HTTP method.

## Hello World

Let's write a simple "Hello World" script for the internal HTTP server. Create
and open `scripts/http-hello-word.coffee` in your text editor of choice. We'll
create a few examples to show of the basics of the internal HTTP server.

    module.exports = (robot) ->
      robot.router.get "/hello", (req, res) ->
        res.end "Hello"

This is a very simple example that will send the response body "Hello" to anyone
that requests `/hello`. As the internal HTTP server is built on Express you can
also use parameters in routes and get the specified values.

    module.exports = (robot) ->
      robot.router.get "/hello/:name", (req, res) ->
        res.end "Hello, #{req.params.name}"

Now if you request "/hello/Jim" the response will contain the body "Hello, Jim".
These examples are pretty trivial.
