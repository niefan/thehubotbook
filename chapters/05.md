# Internal HTTP Server

Hubot has an internal HTTP server built in using Express. This allows scripts to
specify "routes" in Hubot that can be handled by Express internally.

## Getting Started

By default the internal HTTP server is enabled. There is also a default script
that exposes some routes that you can check out.

  * `GET /hubot/version` - will return the version as the response body
  * `POST /hubot/ping` - will return "PONG" as the response body
  * `GET /hubot/time` - will return the current server time as the response body
  * `GET /hubot/info` - will return some info around the hubot process as the
    response body
  * `GET /hubot/ip` - will return the external IP of the hubot as the response
    body.

The basics of a HTTP handler in Hubot is a route and a callback to call when
there is a request made to that route using the specified HTTP method.
