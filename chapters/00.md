# Prerequisites

If you're going to follow along while reading this book you're going to need
access to a Linux, BSD or Mac OS X machine (using a Windows machine is possible
but not used in this book). You will also need the following installed on the
machine to deploy and configure Hubot.

  * Node v0.10.x (http://nodejs.org)

If you wish to deploy to Heroku you will need to also have the following
installed.

  * Heroku Toolbelt (https://toolbelt.heroku.com)
  * Git (http://git-scm.com)

You must be comfortable navigating around using a terminal and know the basic
commands.

The later chapters of the book are going to require you to at least have an
understanding of Node and CoffeeScript. Hubot internals are written in
CoffeeScript however scripts can be written in either CoffeeScript or
JavaScript.
